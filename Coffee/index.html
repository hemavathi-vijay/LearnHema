        We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a
        good night's sleep. We're a little depressed. Coffee solves all these
        problems in one delightful little cup.

        Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a
        beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and
        with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw
        coffee beans must be <a href="Roasting.html"> roasted</a>, the roasted
        coffee beans must then be <a href="Grinding.html"> ground</a>, the
        ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (
        <a href="Brewing.html"> brewed</a>), and finally the liquid coffee must
        be separated from the used grounds.
      </p>

        Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas,
        coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already
        roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation
        and lengthen its shelf life.
